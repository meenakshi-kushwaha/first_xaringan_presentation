This is my first presentation made in R using the xaringan package. I like how clean the presentation looks. 

### Journal Article

Wen, Yifan, et al. "On-highway vehicle emission factors, and spatial patterns, based on mobile monitoring and absolute principal component score." Science of the Total Environment 676 (2019): 242-251.
Paper presentation date - 1st May 2020.  

.Rmd file is in xaringan_pca_presentation/emission factors.Rmd  

#### Sources used to explain PCA 

- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues
- https://towardsdatascience.com/principal-component-analysis-pca-101-using-r-361f4c53a9ff.

Need to tweak .css file to directly add these references to footnote in the presentation.
