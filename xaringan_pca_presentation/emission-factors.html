# What are Emission Factors?

- Pollutant emitted by an actvity

- Expressed as weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity

- Emission factors may differ for petrol- vs. diesel-powered vehicles

# What is PCA or Principle Component Analysis?
- Technique to reduce dimensionality
- Replace large set of intercorrleated variables with a smaller number independent variables
- New variables (or dimensions/principle components) are linear combinations of original variables 

***Remember: Your data stays the same, your frame of reference changes***

# Methods

###Pollutants
  - Measured BC, NOx, CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and PN
  - CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a measure of fuel consumption (traffic volume)
  - Diesel trucks are important contributors to NOx, PN, and BC
  - petrol vehicles emit more CO than Diesel
  
###Set-up
  - petrol powered Buick 
  - 1 Hz measurements
  - Integrated into a database @ 1 record per 10s
      - The information
recorded included test time, longitude, latitude and instantaneous speed from the GPS, and 10-s averaged concentrations of NOX, BC, CO, PN, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; collected simultaneously from five different instruments

# Data Collection

- January 12–18, 2018. 
- Routes were covered two to three times each. 
- ~30 km/h for busy expressways, ~70 km/h for highways 
- ~ one-third of the data were “chase data” 
- Chasing Diesel Truck for ~2min and then regular driving looking for next chase 
- Chased vehicles were based on convenience
- Total Diesel Trucks chased = 300

#Instrumentation

#Data Processing
###Smoothing
- Moving block average
of consecutive observations in a 70-s interval centered on each 10-s observation

###Removing background values
- Estimated bg concentrations with each 10s observation and substracted this bg value from the 70s avg

###Removing outliers
- CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration &lt; 5ppm (Instrument precision limit)
- Concentration value is above the 95th daily percentile value for each pollutant

#Absoluted PCA method

1. Center and Scale all variables
2. Run PCA function in R/STATA/SPSS
3. Compute Principle component scores --&gt; refine results (varimax rotation)
4. Create zero vector and scores --&gt; refine results
5. Compute Absolute principle component scores (#3-#4)
6. Run regression
7. Use regression intercept to compute Concentration contribution from each pollutant
8. Compute emission factor for each fuel (petrol, diesel) using using #7

#Results - Chase &amp; non-chase data

# Results - Mean/median concentrations
.center[![ ](table2.png)]

???
Mean/median concentrations for PN, NOX, BC, and CO2 are
higher for chase than for non-chase data because the chase data
targeted Diesel Trucks, while CO concentrations are comparable for two
datasets in terms of the mean values. *CO is higher in petrol vehicles than diesel hence they are comparable*

#Principle Component Analysis

#Results - PCA for non-chase data
- PN, NOx and BC have high values in first principle component
- CO has higher values in second principle component
- the two components account for 67% of the
variance of the non-chase data.

???
- Higher loadings/coefficients indicate the higher correlation
between them. 
- Because NOX, PN and BC tend to reflect diesel vehicles
and CO is a typical pollutant for petrol vehicles, the first and second
features can be considered to represent diesel and petrol-featured vehicles.
- NOTE: Even though we did not manually select
a diesel and a petrol component in the data, instead, results for
those two vehicle types arise on their own from PCA of on-road
measurements.
- ? question - why not do this without CO2 data since that is predictor of traffic volume

#Results - PCA for chase data (Diesel Truck)
- NOx has high values in first principle component
- PN and BC have higher values in second principle component

variance of the non-chase data.

#Results - PCA for chase data (Diesel Truck)
How does pollutant concentration change with change in traffic volume?
- Slope indicates (relative) emission factor
- Higher emitters have higher slopes
???
For the chase data for HDDTs, the best-fit line for scatterplots of concentration variances between adjacent observations versus CO2 
sheds light on the approximate emission factor for that component.Slope of the orange line which is the best fit line reflects typical fuel-based emission factor for that feature, as CO2 is a measurement of fuel consumption. The slope here is 5-13 times higher for PN-BC rich feature than for Nox rich feature. we are basically able to see the higher emitters seperated form the low emitters. This is consitent with fact that EF of top 5% high emitting diesel trucks is 7-18 times higher than normal emitting diesel trucks. Therefor NOx and PN-BC rich features reflect normal and high emitting patterns for diesel trucks.

#Reminder
###NOx-rich feature refers to NOx being a strong component of that feature. It does not necessarily  mean that (NOx)emission factor is higher for that feature than for other feature (PN-BC rich feature).

#Summary
- APCA approach can differentiate between diesel and petrol vehicles

- High-emitting diesel trucks are 3–13 times dirtier than
normal 

- Removing high emitters can reduce emissions by half

- Identifying and removing a small fraction of vehicles from a fleet can have significant reductions in emissions
